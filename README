2. user go to cart
3. user purchase

About database dump file:
Tried to run it on Intellij AND MYSQL WORKBENCH but failed, showing strange syntax error.
The only way to use it successfully is through command line.
To import it to your database: mysql -u root -p -D bblib < dumpbook.sql
(also commented off all book-inserting lines in datainsert.sql since they are included in the dumpbook.sql)
